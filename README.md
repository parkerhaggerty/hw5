Problem 1
  a) The best fit values are a= -9.96203467932, b= -0.234627756208, c= 9.26282131148
  b) The mean temperature is 9.26125208417 degrees Celsius. Note: this does not include "outliers"
  c) The parameter b represents phase, or time shift, in the curve [aka: when we start observing data relative to the seasons]
  
Problem 2
  a) The best fit linear values are [ 5.85327257 -0.12009479]; the best fit quadratic values are [-3.41715918  6.04845524 -0.12285941]
  b) There appears to be little difference between the linear and quafratic fit. This indicates that the squared term is somewhat 
     insignificant. As a result, I suppose that the linear model is a better fit (mainly for its simplicity).
  c) I could not fit the outliers to a reasonable linear trend
